# Analyzing the Prevalence of Community Smells in Open-Source Projects

### 
Community smells are indicators of social and organizational issues within software development
teams that may hinder collaboration and impact project success. While prior studies have focused
on identifying various types of community smells using metric-based and qualitative analyses, limited
research has addressed their temporal evolution and how these issues can be effectively communicated to
stakeholders for early intervention. In this paper, we present a mixed-methods study to investigate the
evolution of community smells over time and propose strategies for expressing them in developer-friendly
formats. Specifically, we analyze four large-scale open-source projects to examine how community smells
evolve across release cycles and correlate with key development activities. Our results show that community
smells are dynamic in nature, with short release cycles exhibiting a higher concentration of smells.
To complement our quantitative findings, we designed and conducted a survey with practitioners to
explore their preferences for receiving information about community smells, including suitable visualization
methods and communication channels. The outcome of our survey study is that 54% of participants
responded “always” and “frequently” faced the OSE community smells faced in their development, and
34% of participants agreed that the existing community smells reduced team productivity and morale.
By doing so, our work contributes to the growing body of research on socio-technical aspects of software
engineering and provides practical guidance for improving team dynamics and software project outcomes.
